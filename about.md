*Prismatic* is a CUDA/C++/Python software package for fast image simulation in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). It includes parallel, data-streaming implementations of both the plane-wave reciprocal-space interpolated scattering matrix (PRISM) and multislice algorithms using multicore CPUs and CUDA-enabled GPU(s), in some cases achieving accelerations as high as 1000x or more relative to traditional methods. *Prismatic* is fast, free, open-sourced, and contains a graphical user interface.


## File Formats

### Input

Input files containing the atomic coordinates should be in the following XYZ format.

* 1 comment line
* 1 line with the 3 unit cell dimensions a,b,c (in Angstroms)
* *N* lines of the comma-separated form `Z`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `occ`, `thermal_sigma` where `Z` is the atomic number, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the coordinates of the atom within the unit cell in Angstroms, `occ` is the occupancy number (value between 0 and 1 that specifies the likelihood that an atom exists at that site), and `thermal_sigma` is the standard deviation of random thermal motion in Angstroms (Debye-Waller effect).
* -1 to indicate end of file

Here is a sample file, "SI100.XYZ" taken from `computem`, which uses the same format

### Output

Outputs are written to binary [.mrc](http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/mrc_format.txt) files with float-precision. There are potentially 2D, 3D, and 4D output. For all outputs, there are at least two dimensions corresponding to X and Y probe positions. At each position, `Prismatic` can output the full probe (4D), a radially integrated ouput placed into virtual detector bins (3D), or further integrated over a range of detector bins to produce a single value for each scan position (2D). The 3D output is considered to be the primary result and is the only output produced by default; however, any combination of 2D, 3D, and 4D outputs may be produced with a single simulation. The metadata parameter `filename_output`, set with "-o" at the command line, is used as a base filename and modified depending on the output type.

* 2D output: Produced by adding the command line option "-2D ang\_min ang\_max" where "ang\_min" and "ang\_max" are the inner and outer integration angles in mrad. The resulting image will be composed as either "prism\_2Doutput\_" + `filename_output` or "multislice\_2Doutput\_" + `filename_output`. By default this is off.
* 3D output: Controlled by command line option "-3D 0/1" where 0 or 1 is a boolean on/off. The 3D output is saved to `filename_output`. By default this is on.
* 4D output: Controlled by command line option "-4D 0/1" where 0 or 1 is a boolean on/off. The 4D output saves a separate 2D MRC image for each X/Y probe scan position. The output name for each image is tagged with the X and Y scan position index + `filename_output`. By default this is off.

For example, the `prismatic` command 
`./prismatic -i atoms.XYZ -2D 0 10 -4D 1 -3D 1 -o example.mrc`
will produce "prism\_2Doutput\_example.mrc" with the 2D bright field image integrated from 0-10 mrad, the 3D output in "example.mrc", and the 4D output consisting of many individual 2D images with names of the form  "example\_X##\_Y##\_FP##.mrc" where the number values indicate the integer index of the scan in X and Y, accordingly. For example, if the simulation parameters are such that the probe step size is 1 Angstrom, then the file "example\_X1_Y2_FP2.mrc" contains the 2D intensity values corresponding to probe position (1.0, 2.0) Angstroms for the second frozen phonon configuration (assuming that the scan window parameters are set to defaults). For the time being, it will likely require some scripting on the user's part to wrangle the 4D output. In the future, we intend to introduce an hdf5 format to contain each of these outputs in a unified way. 

## GPU Compute Capability

The GPU version of `Prismatic` requires a CUDA-enabled GPU with compute capability >= 3.0

## Using `Prismatic` from the command line

`Prismatic` contains a command line tool, `prismatic`, that can be used to run simulations from within a terminal, bash script, etc. Building it requires the `CMake` variable `PRISM_ENABLE_CLI=1` at compilation time, which is the default behavior.

The following options are available with `prismatic` (you can also print available options and default values with `prismatic --help`), each documented as **_long form_** **_(short form)_** *parameters* : description
