### Past Contributors

[Dr. Hamish Brown](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=QN2mSeoAAAAJ&hl=en) is currently working as a research fellow in cryo-electron microscopy at the University of Melbourne's Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute in Victoria, Australia. He previously currently a postdoctoral position at the National Center for Electron Microscopy at Lawrence Berkeley.  Dr. Brown completed his Ph.D. in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics at the University of Melbourne under the advisement of Prof. Les Allen, and a previous Postdoctoral appointment at the Monash University, Melbourne with Dr. Scott Findlay. His research interests include image simulation and retrieval of structural information in electron microscopy.

[AJ Pryor, Ph.D.,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-pryor-02a52b57/) is a Principal Data Scientist at American Tire Distributors (ATD), where he is a member of the Advanced Analytics Center of Excellence, and was the original principal architect of Prismatic. His Ph.D. Research was in the [Coherent Imaging Group](http://www.physics.ucla.edu/research/imaging/) at UCLA and focused on  developing, implementing, and accelerating 2D image simulation and 3D reconstruction algorithms. AJ is a data scientist and HPC software engineer, and he maintains [a blog](http://alanpryorjr.com/) about these and other topics. You can find some of his other software projects [on Github](https://github.com/apryor6), and he can be contacted via email at apryor6@gmail.com.
